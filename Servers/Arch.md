# Arch Linux

<https://archlinux.org>

I am now running a lightweight Arch Linux installation on my physical servers.  
My services are now either running in *rootless / unprivileged* Podman containers or *rootless / unprivileged* LXC containers on said Arch Linux installation.

The Arch Linux installation itself is pretty much the same as my [Arch Linux VM Template installation](https://github.com/Antiz96/Linux-Server/blob/main/VMs/Arch-Linux_Server_Template.md).
