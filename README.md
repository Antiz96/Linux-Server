# Server Configuration

This is a (non-exhaustive) list of installation and configuration procedures of various services that I set up on Linux servers (either for my personal use or in a professional context).  
It is mostly a summarized documentation and a reminder for myself but, obviously, feel free to use (and improve) it!

This repo also contains my configuration files (Dotfiles) and the Ansible Playbooks I use to automate various administration tasks.
